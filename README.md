# Recycled-Connections

A adafruit sound FX board is connected to an amplifier, which is then connected to a large speaker. The pinouts connect to the stem of the leaves, and the GND wire is touched to the pads to trigger a sound effect. It worked! Bunches of leaves will be made and connected to larger gauge wire.
